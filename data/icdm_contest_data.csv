Mercedes-Benz brought us there to experience the EQC—and possibly to normalize it in a sea of EVs that makes California look like a land of late adopters. Outside Oslo, where cars were larger and more upscale than in other parts of Europe, and Tesla vehicles (S and X) are a more common sight than around Los Angeles or the Bay Area, the EQC fit right in.

That was the feedback current owners of Ford's wild-child, track-rat, flat-plane-crank, manual-only Mustang Shelby GT350 offered when the development team went asking. Although buyers of the Shelby GT350R tend to be pretty accomplished shoes, buyers of the ""base"" GT350 are more likely to drive their cars daily and take them to a track much less frequently. As such, these owners tend to be less practiced and more fearful of wadding up their babies.

Why We Remember It Now:
With the S2000 being one of the most beloved Honda sports cars in existence, we figured a closer look at the roadster’s inception would be worthy of your time. Honda has repeatedly ruled out the idea of bringing back the S2000, the open-top sports car it sold between 1999 and 2009 during which it spawned two generations. That doesn’t stop us from dialing our time machine to the mid-1990s to discover the early days of the S2000 and Honda’s first crack at the little roadster. Partially responsible for the somewhat quirky styling of the two-seater was none other than Pininfarina, with the famous Italian design house envisioning the SSM with low-slung headlights and a long hood.",automotiveEngineering

The S has the same swept-back, lower-slung hatchback profile as the other coupe trims, shaving 0.8-inch from the roofline and increasing the rear track by 0.7 inch. It uses the same 2.9-liter twin-turbocharged V-6, pushing out a meaty 434 horsepower and 405 lb-ft of torque. Power is routed to all four wheels through the familiar eight-speed automatic transmission.As a result, performance is snappy.

At least some of them.The Q8 is equipped with the latest version of Audi’s Traffic Light Information system (TLI), which taps into a city’s traffic control system and knows exactly when the lights are going to change. This data is useful in a few ways.First, when you’re stopped at a red light, the car displays a countdown to when it will turn green, which takes away the sometimes frustrating uncertainty and allows you to make better use of your time than staring at the light in anticipation. The timer turns off when there are four seconds left to encourage you to reengage with the road ahead as the light goes green, so you don’t run into anything when you do.",automotiveEngineering

The news comes as the startup released unaudited financial results for the first quarter of 2019, which show NIO lost $390 million as deliveries of its ES8 electric SUV dropped to 3,989 (down from 7,980 during the fourth quarter of 2018).NIO had not previously set a ship date for the sedan, known as the ET7, but the company’s founder and CEO William Li said it is postponed during an investor call on Tuesday.Li said NIO recently decided to build the sedan on an all-new technological platform, which will push back the timeline for the car. He also said NIO won’t be able to build cars on this new platform until it has its own manufacturing facility.

38,"Shopping for a conventional SUV in the Subaru showroom these days comes down to two primary choices, the compact 2019 Subaru Forester and the mid-size 2019 Subaru Ascent. Sure, you also could include the brand's Outback station wagon and subcompact Crosstrek hatchback in the mix. But the Forester and Ascent both are capable enough in many ways to be cross-shopped with each other, depending on what exactly you're looking for. While we've grown to appreciate the overall agreeableness and three rows of seats in our long-term Ascent test vehicle, there's a lot to like about the latest Forester as well.With only two rows of seats versus three in the Ascent, the Forester is 14.7 inches shorter, 4.5 inches narrower, and has 8.7 fewer inches between its axles. Pricing for the Forester starts at $25,270 and can run into the mid-$30,000s, whereas the larger Ascent will set you back at least $32,970 and the top-level Touring model tops $45K. Although the two share a family resemblance, the Ascent's taller beltline and narrower side windows gives it a more traditional SUV-like appearance versus the Forester's tall-station-wagon look. The styling creates two different experiences behind the wheel, with the Forester's expansive windows providing more unobstructed views of the road ahead and to the sides.",automotiveEngineering

It's no surprise, then, that the production car will look nearly identical to the concept car.Patent sketches surfaced of the model via the E-tron Forum, Jalopnik reported on Tuesday. The sketches come from the Chinese State Intellectual Property Office and they nearly mirror the concept vehicle Audi showed  in LA. The car in the drawings has the same squinty headlights, a similar grille shape (which Audi calls a ""sensor array"" since a grille isn't needed for an electric car""), and the same taillights that span the width of the car. The patent sketches didn't even bother to swap in a different wheel design.None of this is shocking. Audi design boss Mark Lichte told Motor Authority at the E-tron GT concept's debut that the concept already featured a sheet metal body. Translation: the car was really close to production-ready at its debut. Audi is already building pre-production prototypes for the electric grand tourer.",automotiveEngineering
41,"From the starting line, the hardest thing to miss is how much the redesigned RX is easier on the eyes than its 2019 and older siblings. Updated front and rear fascias have been fitted to the RX. The new shaping and contouring is said to be keyed towards Lexus' new design language – but to us, the subtle modifications feel more like comparing dialects rather than two completely different languages.The new headlights also add to Lexus' revised design. Coined as ""triple-beam"" LED headlights, the housings have been made significantly more compact and sporty in order to flow with the ""pinched"" fascia. Changes to the rear of the RX are far less noticeable, though the taillights have changed by flipping the red and clear portions of the housing from top to bottom.The angled reflectors also change position and become more integrated into the bumper's styling and less obtrusive to the overall look of the SUV. Lexus says that it did add an optional kick sensor to open and close the rear hatch, something which brings it in-line with most new SUVs on the market.While the controversial spindle grille is still present on the vehicle, angular changes have made it appear less aggressive to say the least. Some of the harshest lines have been smoothed out and replaced instead by a series of angled shapes to promote a sense of flowing and modernization over its predecessor.

And yet, when their latest concept car rolled onto the stage at the opening party it was clear they’d caught the crowd off guard. They did so in a way automakers rarely do (especially one as hyper-focused on the future as BMW)‚ by digging into an obscure moment from the brand’s past. What started as a personal fascination with a faded photograph for BMW’s senior vice president of design Adrian Von Hooydonk, ended up being an incredible project that recreated a classic concept car: the Garmisch.The first time the Garmisch concept rolled out in front of an audience was at the 1970 Geneva Motor Show. A stunning and unique take on BMW’s “Neue Klasse” design language, by the Turin-based design studio Bertone, the Garmisch had been commissioned by Nuccio Bertone himself. He “wanted to consolidate his existing relationship with BMW by designing a surprise show car for the Geneva Motor Show” says Marcello Gandini, who was head of Bertone’s design department at the time. Gandini (who is highly regarded in the automotive design world for having penned a few legendary cars while at Bertone, such as the Lancia Stratos Zero, Lamborghini Miura and Countach) tells us, “We wanted to create a modern mid-size coupe that was faithful to BMW’s design language, but was more futuristic and even a bit provocative.”",automotiveEngineering

Land Cruisers dot the Australian outback, serve as emergency vehicles in the far reaches of South America and ferry United Nations Peacekeepers to conflict zones around the world.This, the Lexus LX 570, is the Land Cruiser’s luxurious corporate cousin. With a more aggressive design, better interior materials and a new two-row option for a lower price, it’s starting to make sense. It’s not perfect, but the LX 570 two-row is the best competitor Japan has to offer against the Range Rover.Toyota’s Land Cruiser and Lexus LX 570 are both built for off-roading, with four-wheel drive, locking differentials and a low-range gearbox for rock crawling. That doesn’t leave a lot of space for the third row to fold, so previous versions of the Toyota twins have featured third-row seats that flip up and to the site. If you wanted a full cargo area, you had to remove the seats. Otherwise, they stayed folded up and looking goofy.Now, you can get an LX 570 with only two rows of seats. This maximizes cargo space and reduces cost, allowing the big Lexus to better compete with Land Rover’s Range Rover and Mercedes’ G-Class, both of which offer only two rows of seats. The LX starts at $87,375 with destination charges, around $5,000 less than the three-row model. Our tester had a sticker price of $88,195.",automotiveEngineering

68,"The 2019 Mercedes-Benz GLS can carry seven adults in comfort.Mercedes' big, three-row sport utility is often overlooked because it's not as flashy or sexy as some other Mercs, but there's a lot of goodness in the GLS. The 2019 model marks the fifth year of this SUV's current design, but our review uncovered very little that needs changing. Luxury SUVs are generally seen as, at least according to the marketing, the sporty option in the segment. The emphasis is always on power delivery, muscle, and four-wheel drive capability. Hauling kids and gear in comfort and style is not so much a part of the luxury utility persona, in the same way that having massaging seats and self-parking aren't generally big marketing points for pickup trucks. Hauling the family around to do things may not be particularly glamorous, but it's where the real daily-use happiness is found.",automotiveEngineering
69,"Tesla's updated Navigate on Autopilot software now lets some drivers choose whether the car can automatically change lanes without his or her input. The automaker says the change is an attempt to make driving “more seamless.” But Consumer Reports observed the opposite in its own tests, finding it doesn’t work very well and could create safety risks for drivers.Tesla added the lane-changing update to its Navigate on Autopilot feature last month as part of a promised upgrade to the package of driver assist features. We first reviewed Navigate on Autopilot in November and found it technologically impressive. But we also raised concerns about its performance in heavy traffic. To enable the new feature, a driver must first change the system's settings, essentially giving the car permission to change lanes on its own. The driver can cancel an automated lane change that’s in progress at any time by using the turn-signal stalk, braking, or holding the steering wheel in place.",automotiveEngineering
70,"According to official EPA figures, the all-electric version of the Hyundai Kona has a range of 258 miles. Its 64 kWh battery powers a 150 kW electric motor, solely powering the front wheels. That combination amounts to an impressive 201 horsepower and 291 pound-feet of torque. The onboard 7.2 kW charger enables this electric crossover to recharge its lithium-ion battery pack in approximately 9-1/2 hours when connected to a Level 2 (L2) charger. If you don’t have that much idle time, connect it to a 45 kW DC fast charger (L3), and you get back up to 80 percent capacity in around 1 hour.The Kona fits into the subcompact crossover category — comparable in size to Subaru Crosstrek, Mazda CX-3, Honda HR-V and its cousin the Kia Niro EV. Passenger volume measures 94.1 cubic feet, which is nearly identical to the Chevy Bolt. ",automotiveEngineering
71,"The CLS 450’s distinguishing visual characteristic is its smoothness, from the exterior to the cabin. I find the CLS 450 to be understated in a good way. It’s not quite as big or dramatic as the S-Class, opting instead for subtlety – but not subtlety without beauty. The lines flow cleanly from front to rear. This is most readily seen in profile, where the unique shape, long hood and short rear decklid can all be seen at the same time. Up front, the grille is the highlight, with attractive detailing featuring small “pellets” that radiate out from the large Mercedes logo in the middle.Inside, the cabin is similar in styling, with a curved dashboard that wraps around front occupants. My test vehicle included subtle LED lighting running from door to door in a seamless line. Everything about the interior feels intentional, from the materials to the ergonomic placement of the controls and even the air vents. The backseat features outboard seats with plenty of sculpting for passengers to nestle into.",automotiveEngineering
72,"My driveway is steep. Over the past couple of months, I started noticing the CTR's traction control light blinking when I drove up it. I also noticed it when joining traffic on a 50-mph boulevard near my house. I've put on most of the Civic's miles commuting, but several trips to the hills surrounding L.A. as well as Randy Pobst ""dusting off"" the racing line at Willow Springs (three laps without a data logger attached—doh!) means the stock Continental SportContact 6 tires were, well, tired. Replacing with original equipment would cost $1,217 in total, but a set of Michelin Pilot Sport 4S shoes ($1,288) would afford us an opportunity to evaluate something different. Our friends at TireRack shipped us a set, and we couldn't be happier. The Michelins produce noticeably less road noise and offer a more supple ride. Imagine the difference between thumping the ground with a clenched fist versus your open palm.",automotiveEngineering
73,"This is the new Bentley Flying Spur. Well, it’s an annoyingly cropped-in section of the new Bentley Flying Spur. But it sounds very much like the most interesting section.That’s because the Flying Spur now has rear-wheel steering for extra cornering nous. And a four-wheel-drive system that only chucks power to the front wheels when absolutely necessary. So yep, most of the time it’s a rear-wheel-drive Bentley, “giving classic sports sedan handling characteristics”, we’re assured in a slightly Americanised manner. Yes, children, that might mean drifts.While the Flying Spur has always been the more agile of Bentley’s limo options, it’s hardly like the Mulsanne is some svelte track special as a benchmark. But this one sounds like it might come with a pleasing amount of ‘handling’ fitted as standard. In a super saloon world already stuffed to the gunnels with monsters like the Mercedes-AMG E63 and BMW M5, we’re more than happy to welcome another into the fold. We’ll just pop another order in for tyres.",automotiveEngineering
74,"Land Rover has taken the wraps off of the 2020 Discovery Sport, which arrives featuring a fairly comprehensive update for the smallish SUV that adds new technology, a new powertrain option and some camera features that will help with both front and rear visibility.Similar to the 2020 Range Rover, the Discovery Sport adds a new mild-hybrid powertrain. It won’t be the base powertrain; that’s still the 246-horsepower, turbocharged 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder that’s mated to a nine-speed automatic transmission and standard four-wheel drive. The hybrid powertrain uses the same engine, transmission and 4WD system but adds a 48-volt battery and bumps up total system output to 296 hp.The hybrid system will be offered on just one trim level, the R-Dynamic HSE, versus five trim levels for the gas engine. And that model will be offered in only the two-row, five-seat layout – if you want the optional third row you’ll have to stick to the gas engine.",automotiveEngineering
75,"People shopping for a three-row family crossover are bound to find that, beyond styling, the differences between models are awfully limited. That goes for dimensions, engine choices, and even underlying vehicle architecture. The new 2020 Ford Explorer is something different. While its styling is an evolution of the vehicle it replaces, this all-new, fifth-generation Explorer represents a radical transformation, offering a fundamentally different driving experience and capability set than both its predecessor and nearly every other family crossover. Chief among the changes is the switch to a new rear-wheel-drive architecture — the only competitor not named Durango to utilize it. The benefits are several: improved dynamics, for one, but also uniquely sporty proportions, with a longer, lower hood, a shorter front overhang, and a longer wheelbase that benefits interior space. While the front and rear fascias are similar to the outgoing Explorer, the profile is profoundly different. The result is an SUV that looks like nothing else in its boxy segment.",automotiveEngineering
76,"The Blazer shares its underpinnings with the GMC Acadia and the Cadillac XT5, and comes with a 193-horsepower 2.5-liter four-cylinder engine and front-wheel drive. A far more powerful 308-horsepower 3.6-liter six-cylinder engine is optional on L and Blazer models, and standard on RS and Premier trims. A nine-speed automatic is standard with either engine; all-wheel drive is available only with the six-cylinder engine. Towing is rated at 1,500 pounds with front-wheel drive, and 4,500 pounds with all-wheel drive.
Assured and responsive, the V-6-powered Blazer Premier does feel more engaging than the mushy handling typical of this class. The Blazer remains remarkably poised and steady while cornering, with minimal body lean. It absorbs bumps admirably, although you will notice you’re crossing them. The strong, smooth flow of power is pleasing in a way no turbocharged four could hope to match, and the transmission shifts discreetly.",automotiveEngineering
77,"The Buick Regal TourX is the spacious all-wheel drive alternative to the common compact crossover.Usually, when the word “wagon” is brought up, many think of a boring box on wheels that might rank below a minivan in cool factor. Those with this sentiment clearly haven’t seen the latest wagons available. Wagons have been undergoing big changes; many of them are adding all-wheel drive and morphing into under-the-radar crossover alternatives.Prices for a new ride — especially a compact or midsize crossover — with AWD can easily reach up to $40,000. Enter the Buick Regal TourX that starts just under $30,000 and offers a ton of space (about 73 cubic feet with rear seats folded down). It will make most five-seat crossovers jealous. The TourX makes it easy to load large, bulky items due to its power lift gate and lower ride height than many crossovers, too.",automotiveEngineering
78,"The Ford Mustang Shelby GT350 was introduced for the 2016 model year to critical acclaim. Most of the praise went to the massive, 5.2-liter V-8 that’s special to the GT350 and its more-aggressive sibling, the GT350R. Unlike the GT350R, though, the standard-issue Shelby gets some notable upgrades for 2019.First off, Ford worked with Michelin to design a new set of high-performance tires. When you’re sending 526 horsepower to the rear wheels, bad tires can limit the speed. They’re crucial to the success of any performance car, especially considering that they can improve handling, acceleration and braking.Next up, Ford re-tuned the suspension and magnetic dampers. Magnetic dampers allow the GT350 to stiffen the suspension for better performance on the track but soften up to handle potholes and bumps for street driving.",automotiveEngineering
79,"Honda is extending the warranties on more than 1 million CR-V SUVs and Civic cars in the U.S. over complaints that gasoline can seep into the engine oil. That problem has raised concerns about the durability of the 1.5-liter turbo engine and about the vehicles potentially stalling, especially in cold weather. Consumers will get an extra year of powertrain coverage—six years from the time of purchase, with no mileage limits. Honda says that the oil dilution issue is rare and that the company is acting to provide peace of mind for its customers. The extended coverage applies to certain 2017 to 2018 CR-Vs and 2016 to 2018 Civics that have the 1.5-liter turbo engine.In a memo sent to dealers, Honda’s manager of auto campaigns and recalls, Brad Ortloff, said oil in these engines could be diluted because of software settings or potential hardware failures.

Many consumers have been waiting for a midsize crossover to slot between the compact Equinox and full-size Traverse—to them, a right-sized crossover with a cool name is a bonus.Second proof point: as I was leaving the office one day, I saw a local police cruiser drive through MotorTrend's back parking lot. It slowed as it passed the parked Blazer, then shifted into reverse and backed up for a second look. The cruiser sat there, checking it out, until it noticed my leaving the building, and then it moved on.",automotiveEngineering

The original car vanished after its debut at the Geneva Motor Show in 1970.BMW says that from the early days of the brand, it was inspired and influenced by Italian design and coachbuilding culture. Bertone developed the original BMW Garmisch as an independent design proposal meant to show off its creativity. The idea was from Nuccio Bertone himself wanting to consolidate the relationship with BMW with a surprise show car for Geneva in 1970.One key aspect to the design of the Garmisch was a vertical and somewhat angular variation of the BMW kidney-shaped grille with square, glass-covered headlights.

An increase to 500 hp (373 kW) or possibly 550 hp (410 kW) seems more realistic, especially since the e-tron already has some eyebrows raised with its current range of just over 200 miles. Initial reports had Audi’s electric SUV going over 250 miles on a charge but the automaker later dialed that estimate back quite a bit. Presumably, the S model would offer a larger battery pack to offset the added thrust without further reductions in range, but a larger pack would also equate to more weight.On the exterior side, we can see Audi would fit the e-tron with a snazzier grille and lower fascia to inject a bit more attitude into the people mover. There are some properly massive brakes behind the black wheels of these test vehicles, though the rolling stock might be placeholders for production rims with more of an EV appearance.",automotiveEngineering

""Summer daylight is so unforgiving and sometimes, a brush just floats the makeup on top of the face, especially if it’s a waterproof formula or you’ve applied SPF,"" – which you should always do, especially in summer. ""Instead of a brush, use your fingers to help melt foundation into the skin for longevity,"" continued Neil. ""Never rub, just gently press and pat. The heat of your hands will help the product absorb without the need for over-blending. I love the 'real' skin look and moulding foundation into the skin like this really gives it that texture. I always start in the centre and work outwards, but I usually use foundation only where it’s needed, rarely all over.""",cosmetics
13,"Street style blogger-turned-entrepreneur Chiara Ferragni has partnered with Lancôme to launch her first makeup collaboration with the beauty company. Announced earlier this week on Instagram, the collection comprises of a lip and face palette, three exclusive shades of the L’Absolu Mademoiselle Shine lipstick, a trio of the L’Absolu Lacquer lippie and a limited-edition Hypnôse Drama mascara — all designed with pink packaging and the winking eye motif signature to The Blonde Salad brand.“I wanted to create a makeup collection that is 100-percent my style,” Ferragni speaks of her new product launch in a press release. “This is the reason why I joined forces with Lancôme. We worked on a product and communication that is relevant for the girls of my generation.”Drawing inspiration from Ferragni’s go-to makeup looks and action-packed lifestyle, the Flirting Palette is made up of four lipstick shades, four eyeshadows, one rosy blush, three shimmering highlighters, a lip gloss and three blushes, allowing beauty enthusiasts to create different looks according to their mood. In addition to its attractive, glittery pink cover, the palette is also designed with a large mirror on the inside, making it a travel-friendly option.",cosmetics
14,"Every now and then, neon pops up as an inevitable yet invigorating fashion trend — one that feels irresistible for implementing into outfits in one way or another, whether it's a head-to-toe DayGlo suit or a just a bright bangle bracelet. But the last time neon looks started hitting the runway, Huda Kattan was struck with the desire for more than just fluorescent clothing and accessories. She was inspired to extend that summery, retro vibe to the face. The result: The founder and CEO of Huda Beauty developed a neon version of the brand's beloved nine-pan Obsessions palettes, aptly named Neon Obsessions Palettes. And she spoke exclusively to Allure about them.“Neon was something I was really obsessed with for fashion. Normally my inspiration starts with what I want to wear on my face,"" Kattan tells Allure of Huda Beauty's existing makeup offerings, which while fully capable of creating bold looks, have arguably been made up of more neutral and traditional shades than what's found in the Pink, Orange, and Green Neon Obsessions Palettes. ""But this time it began with clothing and my fashion obsession. I was obsessed with accessories like the vintage Chanel Lego bag and how the neon acrylic looked lit from within. I wanted to replicate it for the palette packaging and have that tie into the inspiration for the shades as well.""",cosmetics
15,"The Cleansing Balm is also a multi-tasker. It works as a moisturizing daily cleanser, a deeply hydrating overnight mask, and as an aptly described ""melting makeup-removing balm."" But unlike other infamous multitaskers like three-in-one shampoo, body wash, and conditioner hybrids that wind up falling short on all accounts, this isn't a Pyrrhic victory. It has worked well for me in all forms.In terms of cons, the Cleansing Balm is expensive for a skincare product, isn't the most travel-friendly size, and, depending on your skin and makeup routine, probably won't be the one skincare product you need for clear, well-nourished skin.Since it's a balm, I typically use a dual-cleansing routine if I wear makeup to make sure I don't leave any residue behind or impede upon the Balm's ability to nourish my skin directly. If you typically wear thick foundation and plan to only use the Cleansing Balm, you may need to go over it with a wash cloth or cotton pad a couple of times to make sure you're not leaving any residue behind.",cosmetics
16,"Before her royal wedding to Prince Harry, Duchess Meghan spilled many of her secrets to Beauty Banter, and we’re still so impressed with her picks. She described how she likes to do her eye makeup, saying, “I use Chanel Cassis Eyeliner on my upper lash line and water line, and then a touch of shimmer powder adds a brightness and sparkle.” Cassis is a gorgeous deep purple color with brown undertones and we added it to our cart at the speed of light!This Chanel eyeliner claims to be both waterproof and smudge-proof, and hundreds of shoppers are singing its praises, noting how it goes “from day to night” without even one touch-up! “No more raccoon eyes,” one said, while another said it even stayed perfectly put after a shower! Now that’s impressive. One reviewer said this was a “‘have to have’ cosmetic” and we agree wholeheartedly!This liner has a “gentle, soft, silicone-enriched formula” and may apply completely smooth with no tugs or scratches in sight. Even if the tip starts getting a little dull, all we need to do is detach the sharpener on the opposite end and give it a little twist! Just like new.",cosmetics
17,"Speaking of twists, this eyeliner is actually retractable, so all we need to do is twist to make it appear or disappear. Retractable tips are our favorite, partially because we can’t lose the cap if there isn’t one in the first place, but also because it keeps our liner safe from dust, dirt and any accidental smushing!This Stylo Yeux liner comes in a super wide range of shades. Cassis is obviously a go-to, but we can play even more with color with shades like Fervent Blue, Jungle Green or Eros, a dusty pink mauve. More traditional colors are also available, with shades of black, gray, brown and navy. Make sure to check them all out! To use this eyeliner, it’s recommended that we start with “short, feathery strokes” across our lash line for a simple yet stunning look. We can also use this liner to draw a crisp cat-eye or a bolder, thicker border around our entire eye! Play around; makeup is all about having fun in the end!We’re definitely going to grab a few different shades to start off with to totally transform our makeup routine, beginning with Cassis so we can start every day feeling like royalty. Not the worst thing to wake up to, whether we’re in a palace or not!",cosmetics
18,"I’ve always gravitated toward colors that really stand out. So when I came across the vibrant collection of L’Oreal Paris Infallible Eye Silkissime Eyeliners several years ago, it was definitely love at first sight. (If you are more into the classic brown or black look, fear not because this inexpensive pick also comes in those colors, too.)For years, I’d been using eyeliners from prestige brands simply because the color selection was better, so I was pretty jazzed to find a fun collection of liners at a reasonable price. I don’t generally spend a lot on eye makeup simply because it has such a short shelf life, so I was happy to spend $4 on an eyeliner rather than $20+.I instantly fell for the teal liner from the Silkissime collection and was excited to see that it was just as effective as it was pretty. The silky pencil glides on like a dream, and the smooth consistency doesn’t tug at my eyelid like most sharper pencils do.To be honest, I’m still perfecting my cat eye, so I tend to go for gel and pencil liners — liquid liner is not my friend! — and this creamy pencil definitely makes application a breeze. It gives off an intense pop of color I love, and it’s super easy to get a precise line.The Silkissime eyeliner can stay put for up to 16 hours, so it’s always my go-to whenever I’m heading out to a concert or another event where I know I’ll be out pretty late. It maintains its vibrancy all day long, so it’s reassuring to know my eyeliner isn’t going to fail me even when my body is telling me it’s time for bed.",cosmetics
19,"The DHC Clarifying Pore Cover Base is suitable for all skin types, which might just explain why so many reviewers gave this product five stars in their reviews.Whether oily skin or even combination, this primer was designed with many different skin types in mind but with one goal: Smooth skin. This formula can help to minimize the appearance of large pores, help reduce shine and excess oil. But, before we can even discuss all of the benefits, let’s back up just a bit.Using this primer is extremely simple. After finishing our daily skincare routine, we’d suggest making this primer the first step in all of our makeup routines. Apply a thin layer of this primer all over our faces. Try not to avoid any places where we have extra shine or enlarged pores because this formula was made for those trouble areas. Instead, spread this primer all over any of those visible pores, shiny areas and problematic T-zones!This primer was designed to target those super oily or sweaty areas that only get worse as the day goes on. It’s best to think of this primer as the shield and protection our skin needs. When applied properly, our complexions will look naturally matte for hours without any smudges or unwanted smearing. Plus, our makeup will stay in place in the most natural way.",cosmetics
20,"The highlight of the range is the “Flirting Palette,” which comes with an additional touch of sparkle on the packaging. Inside, it offers four lipstick shades, four eye shadows, three shimmering highlighters, a rosy blush and a lipgloss to be applied thanks to the three brushes featured in the product.The rest of the collection includes three exclusive shades of Lancôme’s “L’Absolu Mademoiselle Shine” lipstick, a trio of “L’Absolu Lacquer” lipstick and a “Hypnôse Drama” mascara. Ferragni’s touch has been extended also to the names of the products as lipstick shades are dubbed “Positive Attitude,” “Independent Women,” “Girl Next Door” and “Sweet Mom,” among others.As described in the caption flanking the video on Instagram, the Lancôme x Chiara Ferragni capsule launches today online in Italy on Douglas’ e-commerce and in the upcoming days in the perfumery chain’s brick-and-mortar stores. The international rollout is set for June, starting from the Netherlands, Germany and Spain at Douglas’ stores.

22,"You can use the best foundation money can buy, but when it comes to smooth, long-lasting makeup that won't crease or flake, there's nothing more important than the canvas you start out with. When prepping your skin for a full face of glam, it's essential to start off by applying one of the best moisturizers for under makeup. And like with any other skin-care product, you want to make sure you're using the right formula for your specific skin type.No matter what your primary skin concern is, you'll want to avoid any night creams or rich moisturizers that will be too heavy to sink into the skin, since that can mess with your makeup application. Instead, look for lightweight hydration, and for optimum priming benefits, you can look for a moisturizer that contains skin-smoothing silicones. Though silicones like dimethicone (the most prominent type of silicone in makeup primers) often find themselves on the questionable ingredients list, many makeup artists recommend the ingredient, and dermatologists note that it's hypoallergenic and noncomedogenic.For dry and dehydrated skin types, opt for a lightweight moisturizer that contains multiple hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid or glycerin. And for oily skin, look for a mattifying formula or one that contains acne-fighters like salicylic acid to help keep your pores clear. To brighten and even out your complexion, choose something with vitamin C or gentle exfoliating acids.",cosmetics
23,"Save yourself the extra step in your morning routine by using a makeup priming moisturizer that also contains your daily sunscreen. Garnier's SkinActive Clearly Brighter SPF 30 Moisturizer offers broad spectrum sun protection in a non-greasy moisturizing formula. The multi-benefit face cream is formulated with vitamin C and lipo-hydroxy acid to brighten and exfoliate skin, which helps reduce signs of sun damage, like dark spots, while also protecting skin from future damage. Meanwhile, ingredients like glycerin, vitamin E, and hyaluronic acid help hydrate and lock in moisture.This modest-looking moisturizer has a surprisingly glamorous following. Not only is the Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré a French pharmacy favorite, but it's also one of the most consistently spotted products backstage during Fashion Week (and beyond) in makeup artists' kits. Recently made available in the U.S., the moisturizer is powerful enough to smooth dry skin while still being lightweight. Ingredients like shea butter, soy proteins, and aloe vera hydrate and firm skin without leaving behind a greasy finish.",cosmetics
24,"For oily skin types, moisturizing before you apply makeup might seem like an express ticket to shiny skin. But that doesn't have to be your face's fate if you use a mattifying formula like La Roche-Posay's Effaclar Mat moisturizer. The dermatologist-tested moisturizer works to absorb excess oil and reduce the appearance of enlarged pores with micro-spheres and perlite, as well as the brand's Sebulyse technology, which was developed to target sebum (aka oil) more powerfully than zinc. Salicylic acid also lands a spot on the ingredients list, making it a great choice for acne-prone skin and treating breakouts. Glycerin, dimethicone, and the brand's thermal spring water help create a smooth and even canvas for makeup.Designed specifically to serve as a makeup primer, the First Aid Beauty Coconut Skin Smoothie Priming Moisturizer is packed with tons of good-for-skin ingredients to help hydrate while keeping makeup in place. Coconut water is the star ingredient here, which is full of electrolytes, amino acids, and phytonutrients. Then, to further help support skin health, First Aid Beauty added a mineral blend of zinc, copper, magnesium, iron, and silica, as well as quinoa. And to provide a natural looking glow sans highlighter, micro-pearls were included in the formula to reflect light and create a dewy (but never oily) finish.",cosmetics

They're electric, they're highly pigmented, they're — in a word — neon.The mix of shades in each of the three palettes — which come in Pink, Green, and Orange — were thoughtfully curated, according to the brand's cofounder, Huda Kattan. ""For Neon, we knew that if we only included super-bright, matte pigments that it would limit versatility and potentially intimidate consumers, so we included a variety of bold matte colors and dimensional metallics and shimmers that could all stand alone but also complement other shades at the same time,"" she told POPSUGAR. ""All of our shades look great on any and all skin tones — we test it to make sure."" To help the colors really pop, Kattan suggested using a primer or the Overachiever Concealer as a base under the eye shadow.If you're wondering what the vibrant mattes and high-shine duo-chrome eye shadows would look like on your lids — or how the hell you should begin using neon eye shadow — we've done the legwork for you.

Because of this, we recommend using the tropical-scented treatment two to three times per week, depending on your skin sensitivity.

The beauty guru's line is set to launch on 22 May, but already one item is concerning fans online - a face scrub that contains walnut, going at $22 (£17). Kylie advertised the scrub on Twitter and Instagram, where she hailed it as her 'secret to a fresh face,' adding it could be used every day. But fans and skincare experts hit back, claiming that using a walnut scrub daily can leave micro-tears in the skin, causing premature ageing. MailOnline has contacted KylieSkin for comment. Billionaire Kylie Jenner, 21, is launching a skincare line on 22 May, but fans are already slating her walnut face scrub ahead of release Twitter users warned against using walnut scrubs on the face, as they are 'too rough' for the skin.

One product in the collection, the Walnut Face Scrub, uses crushed walnut as a physical exfoliant, which many fans claim is too abrasive on the skin and can cause more harm than good. “Kinda shocked Kylie’s scrub is a walnut scrub. That sounds so 2013 right? Lmao I don’t mean it in a bad way but aren’t those types of scrubs too abrasive for the skin? Don’t they cause like tiny scratches?

It’s also an easy way to get that monochromatic makeup look that’s been trending season after season. Monochromatic is my go-to makeup trend, mostly out of ease (or laziness) of creating a full-face with one product. There are five pretty Glow Oil shades to choose from in cute mini sizes.

Protein treatments are exactly what they sound like: they're deep conditioners that use proteins (among other ingredients) to strengthen your hair, repair damage, and prevent breakage. Hair naturally contains a protein called keratin, which can break down with chemical processing, heat damage, and sun exposure. That's why protein treatments are a crucial part of the process of maintaining healthy, natural hair. Of course, you don't have to run to your stylist any time you're in need of one, as you can easily buy one from a beauty retailer or drugstore near you.",cosmetics

So, what does an oil free foundation do, exactly? The best formulas out there offer myriad benefits – they’ll work to prevent that T-zone shine, disguise enlarged pores and mattify skin in the most sweat-inducing temperatures. Some even contain active skin-clearing ingredients to make clogged pores and breakouts a thing of the past. But if you thought all oil-free foundations were heavy, matte and drying, think again.

Each pot contains a shadow that's marbelized with another color of glitter, which means each pot can create a bold look all on its own. My favorites in the collection are the iridescent blue shade with hot pink glitter called ""Sorry For Partyin'"" and a magenta hue with fine red sparkle called ""Party Shop.""

The Bella Jade Botanicals Makeup Setting Spray has quietly become a cult favorite on Amazon — not only is it in the top three best-selling face mists on the retailer’s site (with herbal sprays from better known brand Mario Badescu taking the lead), but it has over 1,800 glowing five-star reviews from shoppers who rave that its results are “remarkable” and “astonishing.” Made with only nine ingredients, including several tea extracts (green, white, and rooibos), the setting spray is free of parabens, artificial fragrances, and irritating chemicals. Other than the tea extracts, which all have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits, the Bella Jade spray is also made with methylsulfonylmethane (MSM) and dimethylaminoethanol (DMAE).

46,"MEMPHIS, Tenn. — A common ingredient in most hygiene and makeup products is prompting manufacturers to switch to ""paraben-free"" ingredients. Tanzania Crew had acne issues before she went paraben-free. “I just started researching different products, ingredients that were horrible for your skin,"" she said. “I learned the best thing to do with parabens is to stay away from them, pretty much like pesticides. People understand pesticides. At the time I didn’t know what parabens were."" Many others might not realize what parabens are either, even though shampoo, soap and makeup products marketed as “paraben-free” are becoming more common. Dermatologist Joseph Pietrangelo explains parabens are an anti-bacterial ingredient in almost anything you use. “They are a preservative used to extend the shelf life of a number of different products, whether that be personal hygiene products – shampoo, conditioner, underarm deodorants, face cream, even foods,"" he said.",cosmetics

Though effective and and smart in the concept of cutting through the confusion of serum layering, the Supers never experienced the Glossier hype of say, Boy Brow or the Balm Dotcom.But now, Emily Weiss & Co. are out to change the underwhelming Supers narrative, giving them a second chance to shine (and sell out). They've just reformulated all three Supers by increasing the percentage of key ingredients (while making sure they're still gentle and effective for all skin types), revamping the packaging (now cuter and more colorful), all while remaining loyal to the original goal of simplifying your skin-care routine.AdvertisementWhether you need an introduction or a reintroduction to The Supers, here's the CliffNotes version: There's the hydrating Super Bounce serum — the one in the opaque white bottle — with hyaluronic acid as its hero ingredient.",cosmetics

In the midst of all this new product development, the team somehow found the time to reformulate Glossier The Supers, the range of three serums that the brand originally launched in 2016.The three offerings — Super Pure, Super Bounce, and Super Glow — have been reformulated to deliver faster, more noticeable results. Even better, the amount of serum inside each bottle has doubled. The weight went from 0.5 ounces to one ounce, which should last about three months if used morning and evening.

To improve the products, the Emily Weiss-helmed brand has worked not only on doubling the size of the dropper bottles (from 15 ml to now 30 ml), but also on increasing the percentage of key ingredients in all three serums. For those who have blemish-prone skin, look to the water-gel-like Super Pure that helps balance and clarify complexion with 5% Niacinamide and Zinc PCA.

So when I came across these compact options from the newly-launched makeup brand RÓEN Beauty, I was immediately intrigued.

4,"In 2019,  drones have definitely become an integral part of the public safety landscape  and to some, drones are now considered mission critical. Flashing back to 2015,  drones had shown some progress but were still mired in strict Federal Aviation  Administration (FAA) regulations. The use of drones was limited to early  adopters, many of which already had aviation divisions for manned aircraft. In  2016, the most important factor to enhance adoption was on the regulatory side when  the FAA published new rules for both public agency flight (Certificate of  Authorization or COA) and commercial flight (Part 107). Even after these  regulatory changes, drones did not really start expanding throughout public  safety until the catastrophic hurricanes in 2017. In addition to the  hurricanes, other large natural disasters such as floods, tornados, wildland  fires, earthquakes and volcanic eruptions would unequivocally prove the value  of public safety drones.In 2018,  the Bard Center for the Study of the Drone published a report that over 900  public safety agencies in the United States had received an approved COA from  the FAA.

The challenge, however, will be ensuring that emergency personnel in the field are not overwhelmed with data.

7,"Horry County Council passed the second of three readings of their budget for the next fiscal year during their regularly scheduled meeting Tuesday in Conway. The vote was 10-2. The two council members who voted against it were Tyler Servant and Harold Worley. The main highlights of the budget include a slight tax increase, good pay raises for county staff and bonuses for public safety staff. Under the budget, all county employees would receive a 4.4% pay raise. Public safety employees would receive bonuses based on how long they’ve been working with the county. For example, if a police officer has been with Horry County Police Department for 10 years, they’d receive a $5,000 bonus. Officers with two years of experience would get a $1,000 raise. The budget includes a tax increase in order to pay for public safety improvements, but county leaders said it’s a small enough increase to make it worth it. “The majority of citizens don’t mind paying an extra fee or a small tax increase as long as they are getting a service that they want,” councilman Al Allen said. For a $200,000 home, the tax increase will only be between $10 to $15 more per year.",publicSecurity

9,"Pretrial detention, or keeping a person who has been accused of a crime in jail until their trial, is a common practice. It’s been touted as a way to both ensure public safety and get people to appear in court. But a growing body of research suggests that its effectiveness has been overstated — and that this practice is causing serious harm to the hundreds of thousands of unconvicted people pushed into jails largely because they can’t afford to pay the bail money required to remain free. A new report on pretrial detention released by the Vera Institute of Justice shows that this type of detention has an especially severe effect on marginalized communities — like poor people, women, and black and Latino people. “People who cannot afford to post bail—in particular, people from poor communities—remain in jail, often until their cases are resolved, while those who have access to financial resources are able to secure their liberty,” the authors of the report point out. This isn’t just a temporary hardship, either. According to the Vera Institute, people detained for longer periods are more likely to be convicted and receive harsher sentences than people who pay the required bail fees and are released or are never required to pay bail in the first place.",publicSecurity

Instead, a drone using Cape telepresence hovered above the scene, recording video that will be used as evidence in court, Chula Vista Police Department Captain Vern Sallee told VentureBeat in an interview last week. “We were able to divert other resources to this now very high priority call and potentially save this guy’s life and obviously get two people in custody, recover a stolen motorcycle, and ensure public safety,” he said. The incident is the most recent case in a trial drone first responder program being taken on by the telepresence drone piloting company Cape and the Chula Vista Police Department. Since then, drones piloted remotely by police officers assisted in 21 arrests, spanning 249 flights over the course of 81 flight hours.

11," A federal judge on Friday permanently blocked the Trump administration from imposing conditions that police departments cooperate with immigration authorities to receive law enforcement grants. The Department of Justice exceeded its authority and violated the constitution by requiring grant recipients to allow immigration authorities into jails and provide advance notice before releasing detainees suspected of being in the country illegally, Judge Manuel Real said. Real said he agreed with a related ruling from the 7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Chicago that said: “The attorney general in this case used the sword of federal funding to conscript state and local authorities to aid in federal civil immigration enforcement. But the power of the purse rests with Congress, which authorized the federal funds at issue and did not impose any immigration enforcement conditions on the receipt of such funds.” As a sanctuary city, Los Angeles does not provide the cooperation required by the grants. City Attorney Mike Feuer sought the permanent injunction in a lawsuit after LA didn’t receive Edward Byrne Memorial Justice Assistance Grants in 2017 for the first time in 20 years. The city had received more than $1 million each year from the grant that goes toward hiring, equipment, training and other needs.",publicSecurity

Police investigators are often tasked with hunting for and identifying groups of related crimes — crime patterns. “Investigators have historically built patterns with a process that is manual, time-consuming, memory based, and liable to inefficiency,” Evan Levine, the NYPD’s assistant commissioner of data analytics, and Alex Chohlas-Wood, former director of analytics for the NYPD, say in a February article in INFORMS Journal on Applied Analytics. “To improve this process, we developed a set of three supervised machine-learning models, which we called Patternizr.”  Patternizr, which the NYPD first deployed in December 2016, is a “decision support tool and recommendation engine that consists of a set of machine learning models” to make searching for crime patterns more efficient and effective, Levine and Chohlas-Wood note.",publicSecurity

This debate about “warrior cops,” accompanied by law enforcement’s use of military-like weapons and tactics, has been a central theme of policing critics for years. However, such arguments continue to misidentify the real problem that leads to inappropriate use of force by officers. The problem is not military-style weapons nor teaching officers how to fight for their lives in very violent encounters. Instead, law enforcement faces a battle to ensure officers have a healthy, balanced, and authentic mindset about their role and influence on society.",publicSecurity

The Wiregrass Public Safety Center's ""resources will provide law enforcement officers, firefighters and EMTs an unmatched ability to prepare for the rising complexity of today's emergency situations,"" according to the center's website. ""This will open up a whole lot more opportunities for different types of training,"" said Randy Morris, general services director for the city of Dothan. ""It'll keep them from having to go out of town to train on different types of props. People will be coming to Dothan to train instead of us having to go somewhere else."" According to Dothan police Chief Steve Parrish, this will also help smaller departments get high-quality training at a low cost.

Motorola Solutions (MSI) announced its implementation of APX™ Project 25 (P25) two-way radios into the Maryland FiRST Radio System for Allegheny County. Used by law enforcement, fire departments and emergency medical services (EMS), the radios provide seamless communication across agencies and state borders. For 20 years, Allegany County has used Motorola Solutions for mission critical communications.“Communications is vital in everything we do from a simple control check to a major incident,” said Captain Chuck Ternent, Cumberland Police, Allegheny County, MD. “It’s great to now be able to pick up your microphone and get a clear message through.”The entire Maryland FiRST System is using Motorola Solutions’ routing systems, customer premise equipment and now APX™ two-way radios to serve the county’s population of more than 70,000.“Cross-agency communications is very important,” said Steve Shipley, Chief of Emergency Management, Allegheny County, Maryland. “With Motorola Solutions’ multi-band P25 radios, our officers use one radio to communicate with any law enforcement agencies. This makes a response to a large scale incident that much more seamless; officers don’t have to carry multiple radios to communicate with different agencies.”“By joining the Maryland FiRST mission-critical radio system, Allegheny County experienced immediate benefits including enhanced coverage and interoperability with first responders across the state,” said Mike Leonard, Mid-Atlantic Territory Vice-President at Motorola Solutions.",publicSecurity

51,"Drones are fast becoming a preferred tool for law enforcement agencies in the United States, particularly for tricky search-and-rescue operations. A new report by the Center for the Study of the Drone at Bard College found that 910 state and local first-responder agencies have bought drones in recent years, two-thirds of them law enforcement. Agencies in 619 counties in every state except Rhode Island now have drones, and many have multiple agencies with the technology. Primarily, they are being used to find people who need help in locations traditionally difficult for humans to navigate with conventional vehicles. Drones have largely been adopted to fill the need for some aerial capabilities for public safety officers that were previously covered in a limited fashion by manned aircraft. The Bard study found most agencies with drones did not previously have aerial capability, and 80 percent of those that do now also fly a manned aircraft.",publicSecurity

The Fairfax County Board of Supervisors voted unanimously on Tuesday (May 21) to approve the program, which the county says will “provide an enhanced level of operational capability, safety and situational awareness.” The county plans to purchase between six to eight devices, which cost $3,500 each. Costs are expected to be absorbed in the county’s existing budget. The equipment will be used by the Office of Emergency Management, Fire and Rescue, Police and Sheriff in order to deliver “high-quality imagery, data and customized geospatial solutions,” according to the county. The program will also be used to complete search and rescue, pre- and post-disaster damage assessment, crash reconstruction, and fire management. County officials say the program will not be used to conduct random surveillance, target individuals solely based on individual characteristics or for personal business and other unauthorized uses. The next three months will be spent setting up the program, certifying pilots and completing training. Drones will begin flying between late August and early September. All pilots in the program must obtain a remote pilot certificate issued by the Federal Aviation Commission.",publicSecurity
