Right off the heels of her best-selling lip kits, model Ashley Graham just released the new Revlon Gel Envy Lingerie x Ashley Graham collection of nail polish inspired by natural-colored underthings. These aren’t your mom’s lingerie shades, though. These are sexy and shimmery and great for all skin tones. Graham announced the launch on Instagram, saying: “Can’t wait for you all to try my newest @revlon collab… the ColorStay #GelEnvy Lingerie nail polish collection  these are the perfect nude shades!” You’ve even seen one shade from the collection already.

We’re not exactly sure what color it is but it looks like Bare It Girl, a pretty light shade that makes the perfect base for her sparkly nail art.
